          A six-panel, animated mini-comic about everyday misogyny—how it shows up as interruptions,
          assumptions, and jokes, and how classmates can notice, name, and change it. The aesthetic
          draws from Affinity Designer workflows: clean vector blocks, bold color gradients, and crisp
          typographic hierarchy for easy classroom reading.
